## Description 
This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges that demonstrate basic programming skills in JavaScript. The main focus is on calculating student grades, checking car speed for demerit points, and computing an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits.

### Challenges

#### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
This program prompts the user to input student marks and outputs the corresponding grade based on specified ranges.
- **Grading Scale**:
  - A: > 79
  - B: 60 to 79
  - C: 49 to 59
  - D: 40 to 49
  - E: < 40
-File: `challenge1.js`

#### Challenge 2: Speed Detector
-This program takes the speed of a car as input and checks if the speed is within the limit. It calculates demerit points for exceeding the limit.
- **Speed Rules**:
  - If speed is less than 70, it prints "Ok".
  - For every 5 km/h over the limit, it gives 1 demerit point.
  - If the total demerit points exceed 12, it prints "License suspended".

#### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
-This program calculates an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. It computes the following:
  - Gross salary
  - NHIF deductions
  - NSSF deductions
  - PAYE tax
  - Net salary
- File: `challenge3.js`

-Taxation Information: The tax rates used for this calculation are based on KRA guidelines.
